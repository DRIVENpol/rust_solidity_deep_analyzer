# Solidity Analyzer Ignore File
# List contracts or patterns to exclude from analysis
#
# Supported Patterns:
#   - Exact names:    IERC20.sol
#   - Prefix:         Test*.sol
#   - Suffix:         *Mock.sol
#   - Directory:      lib/*, node_modules/*
#   - Comments:       Lines starting with #
#
# Examples:
#   I*.sol           - Excludes all interfaces starting with I
#   *Test.sol        - Excludes all test contracts
#   Token.sol        - Excludes specific file

# Common exclusions (uncomment as needed):
# *Test.sol
# *Mock.sol
# *.t.sol
# lib/*
# node_modules/*
# IERC20.sol
